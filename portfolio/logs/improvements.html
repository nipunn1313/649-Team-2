</h1>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">18649 &lt;Fall 2012&gt;<br>
Group 2 - Nipunn Koorapati (nkoorapa), Jacob Olson (jholson),
Ben Clark (brclark), Nick Mazurek (nmazurek)<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">For each submission, you should
update this log with a list of ideas or suggestions you have for
improving the project.&nbsp; This could include identifying bugs in the
project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the project
that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new features for
the simulator.&nbsp; If you have no suggestions or issues for a
particular project, add an entry that says "no suggestions" or
something similar.<br>
<br>
Project 1<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    It was not immediately obvious to me what parameters I was supposed to write
    into the .cf file. At first, I was trying to create a SimTime as the first
    parameter, with something like

    TestLight (new SimTime(100, SimTime.MILLISECOND)) .....

    but, that didn't even remotely work, and the error message wasn't particularly
    helpful. Eventually I guessed that it wanted the string "100ms", and everything
    was okay, but I think that there could be a bit more documentation for this,
    maybe even a small example file?
  </li>
  <li>
    Couple of typos which I found:

    1) TestLight.java:169  s/blcok/block
    2) testlight_01.mf:13  s/intialize/initialize

    Also, make clean deletes ALL the class files, including the ones which come
    with the tar file (and can never be recreated).
    This is stupid! Why even include a make clean if it doesn't
    put you in a state which you could ever function from again.

    You should either
    a) Provide the source and have us compile it
    b) Modify make clean to only delete class files which are compilable
    c) Eliminate make clean.

    It was super-confusing when my Elevator didn't run. I had no idea it was
    because of the make clean.

    Didn't notice any major bugs with this lab, but it was difficult to
    find the right resources to get the environment completely set up.  I
    would suggest adding a hint to students to read the mf files for ways to
    set up the cf files since that helped me to get the parameters correct.
    Otherwise, no complaints!
  </li>
</ul>
Project 2<br>
<ul>
  <li>No comment</li>
</ul>
Project 3<br />
<ul>
  <li>Many of the scenarios and sequence diagrams are numbered incorrectly. </li>
  <li>It would be better if the xls files were csv files because we can't
  effectively work on these tasks in parallel and they don't merge well.</li>
  <li>Peer reviews should be an html form instead of an excel sheet</li>
</ul>

Project 4<br />
<ul>
  <li>Be clear about state variables in the examples. DoorControl has a state
  variable for Dwell which always matches up with mDesiredDwell. For
  time-triggered, that's not really necessary. Is there a reason it's
  there?</li>
  <li>Be clear about where CarWeight is compared to MaxCarCapacity. DoorControl
  makes the comparison for us, however it is not clear if CarWeightAlarm
  is also making the comparison. mCarWeight is the message sent to DoorControl
  and CarWeightAlarm but it seems like it should send mOverweight or something 
  similar.</li>
</ul>

Project 5<br />
<ul>
  <li>Nothing yet</li>
</ul>
