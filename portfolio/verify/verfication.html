<h2>Verification Framework Description</h2>
To verify requirements R-T6 through R-T10, we constructed a state chart for
each requirement that monitors the relevant elevator state. Each state chart
below has been implemented as a separate .java file, for modularity's sake
<br/>
<h3>R-T6</h3>
It must be verified that whenever the car stops, it is at a floor for which
there are pending calls. This means that stopping where there is no floor
should result in a warning, and stopping at a floor for which there are no
hall calls or car calls shall result in a warning.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>R-T7</h3>
It must be verified that whenever the car opens any door, it is at a
hallway for which there are pending calls. This means that if a door is open at
a hallway, and there are no hall calls or car calls for that specific hallway
on that specific floor, a warning shall be issued.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>R-T8.1</h3>
It must be verified that whenever the car opens any door, if there is a
pending call on a different floor, a car lantern turns on. So, when the door
opens, if there is a hall call or car call at a different floor AND both car
lanterns are off, this constitutes an illegal state, and a warning shall be
issued.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>R-T8.2</h3>
It must be verified that whenever the direction indicated by the car lanterns
should not change while the elevator doors are not closed. So, when the door
opens, the state of the car lanterns should be noted. If either car lantern
changes state while any door is still open, a warning shall be issued.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>R-T8.3</h3>
It must be verified that whenever a car lantern is lit at a floor, after it has
left, it first services any pending calls in the same direction as the car
lantern. So, when car doors first open at a floor, the direction that the car
lantern indicates should be noted. Then, whenever the car moves from the floor,
if the movement is in the opposite direction that the car lantern indicated,
a warning shall be issued.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>R-T9</h3>
To ensure that the car travels at fast speed as much as possible, the
CommitPoint calculation must be performed to know whether it is feasible for
the car to advance its speed. Therefore, if the car's measured drive speed is
equal to the SLOW speed, and the CommitPoint has not been reached for the
desired floor, we can deduce that the car can go faster, thus violating the
requirement. A warning shall be issued in this case.<br/>
<br/>

<h3>R-T10</h3>
It must be verified that if a door is commanded to Nudge, at least one door
reversal shall have occurred before doing so. To verify this, when the door
reopens after receiving an mDoorReversal, the first door reversal shall 
be recorded. If a Nudge proceeds to happen after this door reversal, this 
generates no warning. A Nudge in any other circumstance shall result in a 
warning.

<h2>Verification Results</h2>
        The elevator fails R-T7 and R-T8.1. <br/>
        <br/>
        R-T7 is failed because of requirement 5.6. When DoorControl detects
        that the car is stopped at the desired floor and the doors are closed,
        it commands them to open, providing wrong behavior when there are no
        pending calls on other floors.<br/>
        <br/>
        R-T8.1 is failed because of the Dispatcher. LanternControl relies on
        mDesiredFloor, and the Dispatcher delivers the wrong one. The failures
        occur because of how the Dispatcher handles HallCalls and CarCalls,
        specifically in requirements 11.7.1 and 11.7.2, where Dispatcher
        invokes the NextFloor macro. The NextFloor macro makes the assumption
        that when a person makes a hall call, the mHallCall signal is sent out
        until the elevator stops at the hallway. In reality, this signal is
        only sent out in the brief moment when the person presses the hall call
        button. What we should be using is mHallLight, since this has the
        desired action. As a result of this, the wrong mDesiredFloor is sent
        out all of the time.
